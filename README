SETUP
It should be enough to just run the setup.py script.

Automatically run script after boot:
add to /etc/network/interfaces, under the description of your network
interface, e.g. auto eth1

    post-up /path/to/login.py


Automatically run script every hour:

    sudo crontab -e

then add the following line and save:

    2 * * * * /path/to/login.py
